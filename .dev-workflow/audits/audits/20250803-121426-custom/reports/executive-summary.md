# Executive Summary - Custom Filtering Audit

**Audit ID**: 20250803-121426-custom  
**Date**: Sun Aug 3 12:17:00 2025  
**Type**: Custom (filtering function conflicts)  
**Status**: Completed  

## Overview

This audit evaluated the project's filtering system for conflicts and inconsistencies in period-based filtering (MTD/QTD/YTD).

## Key Findings

### Critical Issues: 0

### High Priority Issues: 2
- Multiple filter state management approaches
- Conflicting period determination logic

### Medium Priority Issues: 2
- Multiple filter component implementations
- Inconsistent filter parameter passing

### Low Priority Issues: 1
- Redundant filter validation logic

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: ⚠️ Needs Improvement (Score: 12)

Several issues require attention to ensure consistent filtering behavior across the application.

## Root Cause Analysis

The filtering conflicts stem from:
1. **Evolution over time**: Multiple filter components created for different use cases
2. **State synchronization**: Filter state managed in multiple places
3. **Implicit vs Explicit**: Period type determined both by user selection and derived from other selections

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Consolidate filter state management in FilterContext
2. **Short-term**: Standardize filter parameter passing across all services
3. **Medium-term**: Refactor multiple filter components into single configurable component
4. **Long-term**: Implement comprehensive filter state testing

## Next Steps

1. Review detailed findings report
2. Create fix branch for filter consolidation
3. Implement centralized filter state management
4. Add unit tests for filter logic
