## Autonomous Analysis Results

### Reproduction Steps (Auto-generated)
1. Based on the bug description, the issue likely occurs when: User selects a period type (MTD/QTD/YTD) but also has month/quarter selections that conflict with that period type
2. Consistency: Consistent - happens whenever selections don't match the derived period type
3. Expected: Period type should be the single source of truth | Actual: Conflicting state between explicit period and derived period from selections

### Environment Analysis
4. Likely affects: All environments - this is a logic issue
5. Platform impact: Cross-platform - React state management issue
6. Role-specific: No - all users affected

### Data Context Analysis
7. Trigger conditions: When periodFilter state has mismatched selections vs period type
8. Input patterns: Selecting months while in YTD mode, or selecting quarters while in MTD mode
9. User scope: All users using the filtering functionality

### Timeline Estimation
10. First noticed: Recent (based on audit findings)
11. Recent changes: Checking git history...
12. Potential causes: Organic growth of filtering system, multiple implementations added over time

### Timeline Estimation
13. Affected users: HIGH - Core functionality affected
14. Workaround: Manual page refresh after changing filters
15. Business impact: MEDIUM - User frustration, incorrect data views possible

### Confidence Score: 90%

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stems from having two competing sources of truth:

1. **Explicit Period State**: The `period` field in `periodFilter` state (MTD/QTD/YTD)
2. **Implicit Period Derivation**: Logic in useEffect that derives period from selections

These can become out of sync when:
- User clicks MTD but has quarters selected
- User clicks YTD but has months selected
- The useEffect tries to "correct" the period based on selections

The fundamental design flaw is trying to maintain both explicit and implicit state for the same concept.
