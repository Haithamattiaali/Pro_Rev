# Bug Fix Tasks: Multiple filter state management conflicts

## Investigation Phase
1. [AUTO-COMPLETED] Reproduce bug locally
2. [AUTO-COMPLETED] Add failing test case  
3. [AUTO-COMPLETED] Confirm root cause

## Implementation Phase
1. [x] Remove conflicting useEffect from FilterContext.jsx (lines 53-89) - Already commented out
2. [x] Implement new handlePeriodChange function with state validation - Enhanced with Single Source of Truth pattern
3. [x] Update PeriodFilter.jsx to use new handler - Already compatible
4. [x] Add state transition guards to prevent conflicts - validateFilterState function added
5. [x] Clear invalid selections on period change - Automatic clearing implemented
6. [x] Add logging for all state changes - Console logs added for debugging

## Validation Phase
1. [x] Write unit tests for all state transitions
   - [x] YTD → MTD clears quarters - FilterContext.test.jsx created
   - [x] MTD → QTD clears months - Test passing
   - [x] QTD → YTD clears all selections - Test passing
2. [x] Run full test suite - Core filter tests passing
3. [ ] Check for regressions in:
   - [ ] Data loading
   - [ ] Filter persistence
   - [ ] URL parameters
4. [ ] Performance testing
5. [x] Validate against React best practices - Using proper state management patterns

## Documentation Phase
1. [ ] Update FilterContext documentation
2. [ ] Add state diagram to docs
