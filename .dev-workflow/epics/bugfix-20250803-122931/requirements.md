# Bug Fix Requirements: Multiple filter state management approaches causing conflicts between explicit period selection and implicit period derivation in FilterContext

## Bug Summary
- **Description**: Multiple filter state management approaches causing conflicts between explicit period selection and implicit period derivation in FilterContext
- **Type**: state_management
- **Mode**: Autonomous
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - User frustration, incorrect data views possible
- **Severity**: HIGH - Core functionality affected
- **Root Cause**: Dual state management - both explicit period and derived period from selections

## Reproduction Steps
1. Select YTD period in the filter
2. Then select specific months
3. Observe that period changes to MTD automatically
4. Click YTD again
5. Notice the months are still selected, creating confusion

## Fix Requirements
### SHOULD
- Fix the immediate bug by establishing single source of truth
- Prevent regression with comprehensive state validation
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing saved filters
- Add appropriate unit and integration tests
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Add comprehensive logging for state changes
- Clear invalid selections when period changes
- Ensure consistent behavior across all filter components

### SHOULD NOT
- Break existing functionality
- Degrade performance
- Introduce new dependencies
- Change public APIs (unless necessary)
- Allow conflicting states to exist
- Skip validation of state transitions

## Success Criteria
- Bug no longer reproducible
- All tests pass (new and existing)
- No performance regression
- Code review approved
- State transitions are predictable and logged
- Filter behavior is consistent across the application
- No conflicting states possible
