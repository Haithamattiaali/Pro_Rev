# Console Bug Fix Summary

## Fixed: SyntaxError - Importing binding name 'api' is not found

### Changes Made
1. **src/services/lastCompliantMonthService.js**
   - Line 1: Changed `import { api } from './api.service.js';` to `import api from './api.service';`
   - This fixes the import to use default import syntax and removes unnecessary .js extension

2. **src/services/__tests__/dataService.test.js**
   - Line 3: Changed `import { api } from '../api.service';` to `import api from '../api.service';`
   - Line 6-9: Updated mock to use `default` instead of named export

### Root Cause
The error occurred because:
- `api.service.js` exports a default instance: `export default new ApiService()`
- The import was trying to destructure a named export that doesn't exist
- This is a common ES6 module syntax error

### Verification
After applying these fixes:
1. The SyntaxError should be resolved
2. The development server should start without import errors
3. The YTD/QTD/MTD filters should work correctly with data-aware logic
4. Tests should run without import issues

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues:
- Always check whether a module uses default or named exports
- Maintain consistency in import/export patterns
- Consider adding ESLint rules for import validation
- Document export patterns in service files

## Status: âœ… FIXED

The import binding error has been resolved. The application should now load correctly with the new LastCompliantMonthService integrated into the data-aware filter system.
