# Progress Report - Daily Achievement Enhancement

## Epic: enhance-daily-achievement-20250805-165508
Last Updated: Mon Aug 5 17:30:00 2025

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Created Daily Calculation Helper Function**
   - Added `getDailyCalculationSQL()` method
   - Handles both single and multi-month aggregations
   - Properly sums calendar days for accurate daily averages
   - Uses COALESCE to handle null days (defaults to 30)

2. **Updated getOverviewData Method**
   - Added daily calculations to main SQL query
   - Added daily fields to response object:
     - dailyTarget
     - periodTarget
     - dailyAchievement
     - daysWorked
     - calendarDays
   - Updated service breakdown with daily metrics

3. **Updated getOverviewDataMultiSelect Method**
   - Added daily calculations for multi-select filters
   - Handles aggregation across multiple months/years
   - Service breakdown includes daily metrics

4. **Updated Business Unit Data**
   - SQL query includes daily calculations
   - Response automatically includes daily fields via spread operator

5. **Updated Customer Data**
   - SQL query includes daily calculations
   - Response automatically includes daily fields via spread operator

### üîÑ In Progress Tasks

1. **Testing Daily Calculations**
   - Need to verify calculations with test data
   - Test edge cases (zero targets, null days)
   - Validate multi-month aggregations

2. **Excel Export Updates**
   - Need to add daily metrics to export service
   - Include in overview, business unit, and customer exports

### ‚ùå Not Started

None - all planned backend tasks are completed or in progress

## Technical Details

### SQL Implementation
The daily calculations are now part of all major queries:
```sql
-- Daily target = Monthly Target √∑ Calendar Days
-- Period target = Daily Target √ó Days Worked
-- Daily achievement = (Revenue √∑ Period Target) √ó 100
```

### API Response Structure
All API endpoints now return:
```json
{
  "dailyTarget": 48387.10,
  "periodTarget": 967742.00,
  "dailyAchievement": 127.2,
  "daysWorked": 20,
  "calendarDays": 31
}
```

### Edge Case Handling
- Zero targets: Returns 0 for all daily metrics
- Null days: Defaults to 30 days
- Multi-month: Properly sums calendar days

## Risk Assessment

- **Performance**: ‚úÖ Minimal impact - calculations done in SQL
- **Compatibility**: ‚úÖ No breaking changes - only additions
- **Accuracy**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs testing with real data

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with various scenarios
2. Update Excel export service
3. Document the new API fields
4. Monitor performance impact
