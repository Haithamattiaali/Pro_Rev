# Enhancement Epic: Implement Daily Achievement Calculations

## Epic ID: enhance-daily-achievement-20250805-165508
Generated: Mon Aug 5 16:55:08 2025

## Background

Based on the comprehensive validation report from help session help-20250805-162214, we identified that:

1. **Service Calculations**: ✅ FULLY CONSISTENT - All calculations match perfectly across backend, service layer, and UI
2. **Daily Achievement Logic**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Infrastructure exists but logic is not active

## Major Findings from Validation

### What EXISTS:
- Calendar days calculation functions with leap year support
- "Days" column in database for worked days tracking
- Documented formulas for daily achievement calculations
- SQL helper functions for calendar days

### What's MISSING:
- No active daily target calculations in the codebase
- Days column exists but is not used in any calculations
- Daily achievement feature appears to have been removed/disabled

## Enhancement Objectives

1. **Activate Daily Achievement Calculations**
   - Implement daily target calculation: `Monthly Target / Calendar Days in Month`
   - Calculate period target: `Daily Target × Days Worked`
   - Calculate daily achievement: `(Revenue / Period Target) × 100`

2. **Utilize the "Days" Column**
   - Currently stored but unused
   - Enable partial month calculations
   - Default to 30 days if not provided

3. **Integration Points**
   - Update backend SQL queries to include daily calculations
   - Add daily metrics to API responses
   - Display daily achievement in UI components

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (data.service.js):
```javascript
// Add to getOverviewData and other relevant methods
const dailyTarget = monthlyTarget / getCalendarDaysInMonth(year, month);
const periodTarget = dailyTarget * daysWorked;
const dailyAchievement = (revenue / periodTarget) * 100;
```

### SQL Query Updates:
```sql
SELECT 
  target / ${getCalendarDaysSQL()} as daily_target,
  (target / ${getCalendarDaysSQL()}) * days as period_target,
  CASE 
    WHEN ((target / ${getCalendarDaysSQL()}) * days) > 0 
    THEN (revenue / ((target / ${getCalendarDaysSQL()}) * days)) * 100
    ELSE 0
  END as daily_achievement
```

## Audit Monitoring

Per user request, this epic includes audit monitoring to track implementation progress every 5 minutes.

## Success Criteria

1. Daily target calculations are active and accurate
2. Days column is utilized in all relevant calculations
3. Daily achievement metrics appear in dashboard
4. All existing functionality remains intact
5. Calculations handle edge cases (zero targets, null values)

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Infrastructure already exists, just needs activation
- **Medium Risk**: Ensure backward compatibility with existing data
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of edge cases and validation

## Next Steps

1. Review existing calendar days functions
2. Implement daily calculations in backend service
3. Update SQL queries to include daily metrics
4. Add daily achievement to API responses
5. Update UI to display daily metrics
6. Test with various date scenarios
