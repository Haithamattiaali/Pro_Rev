# Implementation Questions - Daily Achievement Enhancement

## Business Logic Questions

1. **Daily Target Display**
   - Should daily targets be displayed on all dashboard views?
   - Which specific pages should show daily achievement metrics?
   - Should we show both monthly and daily achievement side by side?

2. **Days Worked Handling**
   - How should we handle months where days worked > calendar days?
   - Should partial days be allowed (e.g., 25.5 days)?
   - What's the business rule for weekends/holidays?

3. **Historical Data**
   - Should daily achievement be calculated for historical data?
   - How far back should daily calculations apply?
   - Should existing reports be updated with daily metrics?

## Technical Implementation Questions

4. **UI/UX Presentation**
   - Where exactly should daily achievement appear in the UI?
   - Should it be a separate metric card or integrated into existing cards?
   - What format for display (percentage, daily target amount, both)?

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Should daily calculations be pre-computed and stored?
   - Or calculated on-the-fly for each request?
   - Impact on dashboard loading times?

6. **Data Validation**
   - What validation rules for the "days" column?
   - Maximum days allowed per month?
   - Handling of missing days data?

## Integration Questions

7. **Excel Import/Export**
   - Should daily metrics be included in Excel exports?
   - Required changes to import templates?
   - Backward compatibility with existing Excel files?

8. **API Response Structure**
   - Add daily metrics to existing endpoints or create new ones?
   - Should daily data be optional (query parameter)?
   - Impact on existing API consumers?
