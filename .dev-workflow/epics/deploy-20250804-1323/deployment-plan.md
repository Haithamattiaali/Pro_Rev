Generated: Sun Aug 4 13:23:00 2025
Site: proceed-revenue-dashboard-1750804938.netlify.app

## Deployment Overview

- **Application**: Proceed Revenue Dashboard (Frontend)
- **Environment**: Production
- **Platform**: Netlify
- **Method**: Direct CLI deployment (bypassing Git auto-deploy)
- **Strategy**: Build locally and deploy directly to production
- **URL**: https://proceed-revenue-dashboard-1750804938.netlify.app (same historical link)

## Prerequisites

### ✅ Infrastructure
- Netlify CLI installed and authenticated
- Site already linked: proceed-revenue-dashboard-1750804938
- Node.js 18.x environment

### ⚠️ Configuration Required
- Update VITE_API_URL to production backend URL
- Ensure production build optimizations

### ✅ Security
- SSL automatically provided by Netlify
- Security headers configured in netlify.toml
- Environment variables managed through Netlify

## Deployment Strategy

### Why Direct CLI Deployment?
- Bypass Git auto-deploy when immediate production update needed
- Useful when Git push doesn't trigger auto-deploy
- Maintains same production URL
- No downtime deployment

### Build Process
1. Update environment variables for production
2. Run production build locally
3. Deploy dist folder directly to Netlify

## Success Criteria
- Application accessible at https://proceed-revenue-dashboard-1750804938.netlify.app
- All caching improvements functional
- No console errors in production
- Performance metrics improved
- Same URL maintained (no new deployment URL)

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Frontend only deployment
- **Rollback**: Easy through Netlify UI
- **Testing**: Local build verification before deploy
