# Requirements: Automated Parallel Deployment for Backend

## Overview

Implement automated continuous deployment for the Render backend that triggers in parallel with frontend Netlify deployment, eliminating manual deployment steps and ensuring both services deploy simultaneously when code is pushed to the main branch.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- **Given** I push code to the main branch
- **When** The push contains changes to frontend or backend
- **Then** Both Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend) should deploy automatically in parallel

### As a DevOps Engineer
- **Given** A deployment is triggered
- **When** Either frontend or backend deployment fails
- **Then** I should receive notifications and be able to rollback independently

### As a Team Lead
- **Given** Multiple deployments happening
- **When** I check deployment status
- **Then** I can see the status of both frontend and backend deployments in one place

## Acceptance Criteria

### SHOULD
- ✅ Backend deploys automatically when code is pushed to main branch
- ✅ Frontend and backend deployments run in parallel, not sequentially
- ✅ Database migrations run automatically before backend starts
- ✅ Deployment status is visible in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Rollback capability exists for both services independently
- ✅ Environment variables are managed securely
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments (rolling updates)
- ✅ Automated health checks after deployment
- ✅ Deployment notifications to team (success/failure)

### SHOULD NOT
- ❌ Require manual intervention for standard deployments
- ❌ Deploy when only documentation changes
- ❌ Expose sensitive credentials in logs
- ❌ Allow deployments without passing tests
- ❌ Create database inconsistencies during deployment

## Technical Requirements

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Trigger on push to main branch
- Run frontend and backend jobs in parallel
- Skip deployment if only docs change
- Require all tests to pass before deployment

### Render Configuration
- Use Render API or CLI for deployment
- Configure automatic deploys
- Set up deploy hooks
- Enable zero-downtime deployments

### Database Handling
- Run migrations automatically
- Backup database before migrations
- Handle rollback scenarios
- Ensure data persistence

### Monitoring & Notifications
- Slack/Email notifications on deployment status
- Health check monitoring
- Performance metrics after deployment
- Error tracking integration

## Dependencies

### External Services
- GitHub Actions (already in use)
- Render API/CLI
- Netlify (already configured)
- Notification service (Slack/Email)

### Secrets Required
- `RENDER_API_KEY` - For Render deployments
- `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` - Backend service identifier
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - If using Netlify CLI
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For notifications

### Existing Infrastructure
- Current manual deployment process
- render.yaml configuration
- Database disk mount on Render
- GitHub repository with workflows

## Success Metrics

- Deployment time reduced from manual (10-15 min) to automated (3-5 min)
- Zero failed deployments due to manual errors
- Parallel deployment reduces total deployment time by 50%
- Team notification within 30 seconds of deployment completion
- 99.9% deployment success rate

## Security Considerations

- All secrets stored in GitHub Secrets
- API keys have minimal required permissions
- Deployment logs sanitized of sensitive data
- Database backups encrypted
- Network traffic uses HTTPS only

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Database corruption during migration - Mitigated by automatic backups
- API key exposure - Mitigated by GitHub Secrets and log sanitization

### Medium Risk
- Deployment failure blocking releases - Mitigated by rollback capability
- Performance issues after deployment - Mitigated by health checks

### Low Risk
- GitHub Actions downtime - Can fall back to manual deployment
- Notification failures - Non-critical, logged for review
