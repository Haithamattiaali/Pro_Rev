Generated: Sun Aug 4 07:03:00 2025
Environment: Production
Status: Ready for Deployment

## Deployment Overview

- **Application**: Proceed Revenue Dashboard (Frontend + Backend)
- **Environment**: Production
- **Frontend Platform**: Netlify
- **Backend Platform**: Render
- **Strategy**: Continuous Deployment via Git Push
- **Current Branch**: feature/smooth-filter-transitions

## Changes to Deploy

### Major Features
1. **Data-Aware YTD/QTD/MTD Filters**
   - Filters now use last uploaded data month as "current"

2. **Auto-Refresh After Upload**
   - Dashboard automatically updates after Excel upload
   - No manual browser refresh needed

3. **Partial Quarter Support**
   - Q3 is selectable with partial data (e.g., Aug without Sep)
   - Visual indicators for partial quarters

### Components Added/Modified
- New: `DataAvailabilityIndicator.jsx` - Shows last upload period
- New: `lastCompliantMonthService.js` - Determines last compliant month
- Modified: `HierarchicalFilterContext.jsx` - Auto-refresh integration
- Modified: `PeriodSelector.jsx` - Partial quarter logic
- Modified: Filter components with brand styling

## Prerequisites Checklist

- [x] All code committed to feature branch
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [x] Environment variables configured:
  - Frontend: `VITE_API_URL` pointing to production backend
  - Backend: Production database configured
- [ ] Feature branch ready to merge to main/master
- [ ] Team notification sent

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Merge to Main Branch

```bash
# Ensure you're on feature branch
git checkout feature/smooth-filter-transitions

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge or rebase with main
git checkout main
git merge feature/smooth-filter-transitions

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

Netlify will automatically:
1. Detect push to main branch
2. Run build command: `npm run build`
3. Deploy `dist` directory
4. Apply redirects and headers from `netlify.toml`

**Verify at**: https://proceed-revenue-dashboard-1750804938.netlify.app

### Step 3: Backend Deployment (Render)

Render will automatically:
1. Detect push to main branch
2. Run build: `npm install`
3. Start server: `node server.js`
4. Mount SQLite disk at `/var/data`

**Verify at**: Your Render backend URL

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Check Frontend**:
   - Load dashboard
   - Verify "Last upload period" shows correctly
   - Test YTD/QTD/MTD filters work with data dates
   - Upload test Excel file
   - Confirm auto-refresh works

2. **Check Backend**:
   - Test `/api/health` endpoint
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check upload endpoint works

3. **Test Critical Paths**:
   - Upload Excel file
   - Switch between YTD/QTD/MTD
   - Select Q3 with August data
   - Verify data displays correctly

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur:

### Frontend Rollback
```bash
# In Netlify Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deploys
# 2. Find previous successful deploy
# 3. Click "Publish deploy"

# Or via Git:
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Backend Rollback
```bash
# In Render Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Events
# 2. Find previous deploy
# 3. Click "Rollback"

# Or via Git:
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (Netlify)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-render-backend.onrender.com/api
```

### Backend (Render)
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
```

## Monitoring

After deployment:
1. Monitor browser console for errors
2. Check Netlify function logs
3. Monitor Render logs for backend errors
4. Test data upload functionality
5. Verify filter calculations

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] "Last upload period" displays correctly
- [ ] YTD/QTD/MTD use uploaded data dates
- [ ] Q3 is clickable with August data
- [ ] Auto-refresh works after upload
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## Notes

- Deployment is automated via Git push
- Both platforms support instant rollback
- Database persists on Render disk mount
- Consider announcing deployment to users
