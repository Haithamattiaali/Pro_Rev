# Production Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The production deployment was not showing the latest UI improvements (smooth filters, logo, stable transitions) that were working in development.

## Root Cause
1. All improvements were already merged to master branch
2. Netlify CDN cache was not recognizing the files as changed
3. The deployment was serving old cached versions

## Solution Applied
1. Verified all commits are in master branch ✓
2. Built fresh production bundle with logo and all fixes ✓
3. Attempted multiple deployment strategies:
   - Direct CLI deployment
   - Draft deployment
   - Version bump to force recognition
   - Modified index.html to force CDN update

## Current Status
- Build includes all fixes (logo at dist/assets/logo-BJxaPuQ2.png)
- Partial deployment success (index.html updated)
- Full CDN refresh still needed

## Manual Steps Required
To complete the deployment with all files:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Select your site**: proceed-revenue-dashboard-1750804938  
3. **Go to "Deploys" tab**
4. **Click "Trigger deploy" dropdown**
5. **Select "Clear cache and deploy site"**

This will force Netlify to:
- Clear all CDN caches
- Re-upload all files including JavaScript bundles
- Deploy the complete build with logo and smooth transitions

## Verification After Manual Deploy
1. Visit: https://proceed-revenue-dashboard-1750804938.netlify.app
2. Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
3. Check for:
   - ✓ Proceed logo on left side of filter bar
   - ✓ Smooth filter transitions (no jumping)
   - ✓ Instant data updates when switching YTD/QTD/MTD
   - ✓ No console errors

## Alternative Option
If manual deploy doesn't work, you can:
1. Delete the site in Netlify
2. Create a new site
3. Deploy fresh without any cache history

The build is ready and includes all fixes - just needs Netlify's CDN to be cleared.
