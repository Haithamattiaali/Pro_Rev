### Visual Bug
The Proceed company logo is inconsistently displayed in the PeriodFilter component. The issue is not a JavaScript error but a CSS/responsive design problem.

### Root Cause
1. The logo is wrapped with `hidden sm:flex` classes, making it invisible on mobile devices (screens smaller than 640px)
2. The logo is positioned at the far right of the filter bar, which may cause it to be cut off or hidden on certain screen sizes
3. No fallback or error handling if the logo image fails to load
