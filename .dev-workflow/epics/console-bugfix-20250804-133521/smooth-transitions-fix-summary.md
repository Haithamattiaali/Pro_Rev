# Smooth Transitions Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported that while the Overview tab had smooth transitions when switching between MTD/QTD/YTD filters, other tabs (Business Units, Customers, Sales Plan) showed jarring "rapid vibration" or flickering effects - described as "like when someone takes a camera shot".

## Root Cause
The issue was that the Overview page was using the `useOptimizedLoading` hook which provides:
- 100ms delay before showing spinner (prevents flash for fast loads)
- Minimum 300ms display time (prevents jarring transitions)
- Smooth transition between loading states

While other pages were using simple `loading` state that immediately showed/hid the spinner, causing the flickering effect.

## Fix Applied
Updated all three affected pages to use the same `useOptimizedLoading` hook:

### 1. Business Units Page (src/pages/BusinessUnits.jsx)
- Added import for `useOptimizedLoading`
- Replaced `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)` with the hook
- Changed `setLoading(true)` to `startLoading()`
- Changed `setLoading(false)` to `stopLoading()`
- Changed `if (loading)` to `if (showLoading)`

### 2. Customers Page (src/pages/Customers.jsx)
- Same pattern of changes as Business Units

### 3. Sales Plan Page (src/pages/SalesPlan.jsx)
- Same pattern of changes as Business Units

## Benefits
1. **Consistent UX**: All tabs now have the same smooth transition behavior
2. **No Flash**: Fast data loads (< 100ms) show no spinner at all
3. **No Jarring**: Minimum display time prevents rapid flashing
4. **Professional Feel**: Smooth transitions improve perceived performance

## Testing
All tabs should now show smooth transitions when switching between:
- MTD → QTD → YTD → YEAR filters
- Different months in MTD mode
- Different quarters in QTD mode

The "camera flash" effect should be completely eliminated.

## Status: COMPLETED
