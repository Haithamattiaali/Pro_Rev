# YTD/QTD/MTD Enhancement Summary

## Enhancement Request

Fix YTD (Year-to-Date), QTD (Quarter-to-Date), and MTD (Month-to-Date) filters to:

1. **Use Last Available Data Month** instead of system current date
   - Example: If today is August but last data is July â†’ "current" = July
   - YTD shows Jan-July (not Jan-August)
   - QTD shows Q3 up to July (not up to August)
   - MTD shows full July (not partial August)

2. **Remove UI Animations** except number changes
   - Component under "Currently Showing" vibrates/animates
   - Unprofessional appearance
   - Keep dashboard static except for data values

## Critical Requirements

1. **Data Awareness**
   - "Current month" = last month in uploaded Excel
   - Not calendar current month
   - Must check actual data availability

2. **Maintain Accuracy**
   - No conflicts with existing logic
   - Respect compliance criteria
   - Preserve all validations

3. **Clean Transitions**
   - Remove component animations
   - Only numbers should change
   - Professional, static appearance

## Technical Considerations

### Current Issues
```javascript
// WRONG - Uses system date
const currentMonth = new Date().getMonth() + 1;

// CORRECT - Should use last data month
const currentMonth = getLastAvailableDataMonth();
```

### Components to Update
1. `HierarchicalFilterContext.jsx` - Quick preset calculations
2. `QuickRangePresets.jsx` - Button behaviors
3. `FilterSummary.jsx` - Remove animations
4. Data service - Add last available month detection

## Questions Document
