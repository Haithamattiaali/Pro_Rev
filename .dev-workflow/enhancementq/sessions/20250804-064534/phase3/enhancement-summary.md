# Enhancement Summary
Session: 20250804-064534
Date: Sun Aug 4 06:45:34 2025
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Brand Color Styling ✅
Updated DataAvailabilityIndicator component to use brand primary colors:
- Background: Changed from `bg-blue-50` to `bg-primary/5` (primary color with 5% opacity)
- Border: Changed from `border-blue-200` to `border-primary/20` (primary color with 20% opacity)
- Icon: Changed from `text-blue-600` to `text-primary`
- Text: Changed from `text-blue-800` to `text-primary-dark`

### 2. Text Format Update ✅
Changed the display format:
- From: "Data through {lastMonth} {year}"
- To: "Last upload period: {lastMonth}"
- Updated tooltip text to match: "All calculations are based on last upload period: {lastMonth}."

### 3. Cache Clearing Verification ✅
Confirmed existing implementation already handles cache clearing properly:
- `DataRefreshContext.jsx` line 31: Calls `dataService.clearCache()`
- `dataService.js` line 14: Calls `lastCompliantMonthService.clearCache()`
- This ensures all caches are cleared when new Excel is uploaded

## Visual Changes
The data availability indicator now:
- Uses brand pink/magenta colors (#9e1f63) instead of blue
- Shows clearer text: "Last upload period: Jul" instead of "Data through Jul 2025"
- Maintains consistent styling with the rest of the brand

## Testing Notes
- The component will now show with a light pink background and dark pink text
- Tooltip functionality remains the same
- Cache clearing happens automatically on Excel upload via DataRefreshContext

## Files Modified
- `src/components/common/DataAvailabilityIndicator.jsx`

No additional changes needed for cache clearing as it's already properly implemented.
