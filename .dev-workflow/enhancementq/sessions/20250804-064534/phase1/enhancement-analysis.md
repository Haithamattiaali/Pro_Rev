## Enhancement Request
"for the new added period label i need it to follow my brand coloring and also should show 'last upload period month' instead of 'Data through Jul 2025' also uploading new excel should clear all old caches"

## Initial Analysis
### Scope Identification
This enhancement involves three distinct changes:
1. **UI Styling**: Update DataAvailabilityIndicator component to use brand colors
2. **Text Format**: Change the display text from "Data through [Month] [Year]" to "Last upload period: [Month]"
3. **Cache Management**: Ensure Excel upload clears all caches (including the new LastCompliantMonthService cache)

### Key Components
- User Interface Changes: DataAvailabilityIndicator styling and text
- Backend Modifications: Cache clearing in upload endpoint
- Data Model Updates: None required
- Integration Points: Upload service, cache management

### Potential Impact Areas
- Existing Features: Data availability display across all dashboards
- Performance: Cache clearing will ensure fresh data
- Security: No security implications
- User Experience: Clearer indication of data period with brand consistency

## Brand Color Analysis
Based on the Brand DNA document:
- Primary: #9e1f63
- Primary Dark: #721548
- Primary Light: #cb5b96
- Secondary: #424046
- Accent Blue: #005b8c (currently used)

The component currently uses blue colors (blue-50, blue-600) which should be changed to brand primary colors.
