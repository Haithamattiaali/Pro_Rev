## Enhancement Request
when user click any period like monthe or quarter there is transition happen. its like harsh vibration tottally disappointing on ui we need to enhance the transition behaviour for the involved pans

## Initial Analysis
### Scope Identification
The user is experiencing jarring UI transitions when clicking period filters (Month/Quarter/Year). The issue describes "harsh vibration" effects, suggesting abrupt or poorly animated state changes.

### Key Components
- User Interface Changes: Period filter buttons and dependent UI panels
- Backend Modifications: None required (UI-only enhancement)
- Data Model Updates: None required
- Integration Points: PeriodFilter component and any UI elements that react to period changes

### Potential Impact Areas
- Existing Features: Period filtering functionality remains unchanged
- Performance: Minimal impact, possibly slight improvement with optimized animations
- Security: No security implications
- User Experience: Significant improvement in perceived smoothness and professionalism

## Root Cause Analysis
The harsh transitions likely stem from:
1. Lack of CSS transitions on state changes
2. Instant DOM updates without animation
3. Multiple components updating simultaneously without coordination
4. Possible layout shift causing visual jumps

## Affected Components
- `src/components/filters/PeriodFilter.jsx`
- Any components that respond to filter changes
- CSS styling for filter transitions
