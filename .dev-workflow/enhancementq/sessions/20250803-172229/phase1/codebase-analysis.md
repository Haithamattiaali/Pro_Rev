# Codebase Analysis for UI Transition Enhancement
Date: Sun Aug 3 17:22:29 2025

## Current Implementation Analysis

### PeriodFilter Component
- Location: `src/components/filters/PeriodFilter.jsx`
- Current transition: Only `transition-colors` on buttons
- Issue: When period changes (MTD/QTD/YTD), the month/quarter selectors appear/disappear instantly
- No transition for layout changes when selectors mount/unmount

### Transition Issues Identified

1. **Instant Mount/Unmount**
   - Month selector appears instantly when MTD is clicked (line 118)
   - Quarter selector appears instantly when QTD is clicked (line 136)
   - No fade-in/fade-out or slide animations

2. **Layout Shift**
   - When selectors appear/disappear, other elements shift abruptly
   - No smooth height transitions for the container

3. **Button State Changes**
   - Button color transitions exist (`transition-colors`) but are basic
   - No scale or transform effects for better feedback

4. **Data Loading**
   - When period changes, all dependent components refetch data
   - No skeleton or loading state coordination across components

## Affected Components
- `PeriodFilter.jsx` - Primary component needing animation
- `Overview.jsx`, `Customers.jsx`, `BusinessUnits.jsx` - Pages that react to filter changes
- All components using `useFilter` hook that re-render on period change

## CSS/Animation Opportunities
1. Use React Transition Group or Framer Motion for mount/unmount animations
2. Add CSS transitions for height changes
3. Implement coordinated loading states
4. Add micro-animations for better user feedback
