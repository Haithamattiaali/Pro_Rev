> Your answer: Executive management and financial analysts who need more accurate profit calculations based on actual performance.

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 What are the must-have features?
> Your answer: 
- Correct formula implementation across all components
- Handle edge cases (division by zero when target is 0)
- Maintain data consistency across frontend and backend
- Update all export formats (Excel, etc.)

### 2.2 What are the nice-to-have features?
> Your answer:
- Toggle to switch between old and new formula
- Historical comparison view
- Tooltip explaining the new calculation

### 2.3 Are there any performance requirements?
> Your answer: No significant performance impact expected. The calculation is simple arithmetic.

### 2.4 Are there any security considerations?
> Your answer: No security implications. This is a calculation change only.

## 3. Integration & Dependencies

### 3.1 Which existing features will this interact with?
> Your answer:
- Overview dashboard
- Business Units view
- Customer analytics
- Excel export functionality
- Forecast module
- Monthly trends charts

### 3.2 Are there any external dependencies?
> Your answer: No external dependencies. All calculations are internal.

### 3.3 Will this require database changes?
> Your answer: No database schema changes required. Only calculation logic changes.

## 4. User Experience

### 4.1 How should users access this enhancement?
> Your answer: The new calculation will be applied automatically. No user action required.

### 4.2 What should the user interface look like?
> Your answer: No UI changes required. Values will update automatically with the new formula.

> Your answer: Consider adding a note or tooltip explaining that gross profit calculation has been updated.

## 5. Testing & Validation

### 5.1 How will we know the enhancement works correctly?
> Your answer:
- Unit tests with various revenue/target/cost combinations
- Verify calculations match expected results
- Compare with manual calculations
- Test edge cases (zero targets, negative values)

### 5.2 What edge cases should we consider?
> Your answer:
- Target is 0 (division by zero)
- Revenue exceeds target significantly
- Negative revenues or costs
- Very small target values

### 5.3 What are the acceptance criteria?

- All gross profit values use new formula
- No calculation errors or crashes
- Excel exports show correct values
- Tests pass with 100% coverage

## 6. Implementation Preferences

> Your answer: 
- Create a centralized calculation function
- Update all references to use this function
- Implement comprehensive testing first

### 6.2 Any patterns or anti-patterns to follow/avoid?
> Your answer:
- Follow DRY principle - single source of truth for calculation
- Avoid duplicating the formula in multiple places
