# Enhancement Questionnaire - Caching Optimization
Session: 20250806-caching-enhancement
Enhancement: Improve caching during filtering for smoother UI/UX
Date: 2025-08-06

Please answer the following questions to help create a comprehensive enhancement plan.

## 1. Enhancement Scope

### 1.1 What is the primary goal of this enhancement?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] Improve the user experience during filter changes and tab transitions by optimizing caching to eliminate unnecessary loading states and provide instant feedback.

### 1.2 What specific functionality should be added/changed?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] 
- Instant cache serving without loading spinners
- Optimistic UI updates with background refresh
- Debounced filter changes for multi-select
- Shared cache between related views
- Smoother tab transitions

### 1.3 Who are the primary users/beneficiaries?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] Dashboard users who frequently switch between periods (MTD/QTD/YTD), select multiple filters, and navigate between different dashboard views.

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 What are the must-have features?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated]
- Zero loading spinner for cache hits
- Background data refresh without UI blocking
- Smooth filter transitions without flicker
- Consistent experience across all dashboard views

### 2.2 What are the nice-to-have features?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated]
- Predictive prefetching based on user patterns
- Visual indicators for cache freshness
- Progressive loading for large datasets
- Offline capability for cached data

### 2.3 Are there any performance requirements?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] Filter changes should feel instant (<100ms), tab switches should be immediate for cached data, and the UI should never freeze during data operations.

### 2.4 Are there any security considerations?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] Cache should respect user permissions, sensitive data should not persist longer than necessary, and cache should be cleared on logout.

## 3. Integration & Dependencies

### 3.1 Which existing features will this interact with?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated]
- FilterContext for filter state management
- DataService caching layer
- All dashboard pages (Overview, BusinessUnits, Customers, etc.)
- Export functionality

### 3.2 Are there any external dependencies?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] No new external dependencies needed. Will enhance existing React Context API and Map-based cache.

### 3.3 Will this require database changes?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] No database changes required. This is purely a frontend caching optimization.

## 4. User Experience

### 4.1 How should users access this enhancement?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] The enhancement should be transparent - users will automatically experience smoother transitions without any configuration needed.

### 4.2 What should the user interface look like?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated]
- Subtle loading indicators only for actual network requests
- Smooth transitions between filter states
- Optional cache status indicator in development mode
- No visual changes to existing UI components

### 4.3 Are there any specific workflows to support?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated]
- Rapid filter switching (e.g., comparing different months)
- Multi-select workflows (selecting multiple quarters)
- Tab navigation workflows
- Data refresh after uploads

## 5. Testing & Validation

### 5.1 How will we know the enhancement works correctly?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated]
- Loading spinners only appear on first load or cache miss
- Filter changes feel instant
- Background updates don't interrupt user interaction
- Cache hit rate > 80% for common operations

### 5.2 What edge cases should we consider?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated]
- Rapid filter changes
- Large multi-select combinations
- Stale data scenarios
- Memory constraints with large cache
- Network disconnection during background refresh

### 5.3 What are the acceptance criteria?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated]
- Cache hits display instantly without loading spinner
- Multi-select operations are debounced appropriately
- Tab switches use cached data when available
- Background refresh doesn't block UI
- No memory leaks from cache growth

## 6. Implementation Preferences

### 6.1 Any preferred implementation approach?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] Enhance existing dataService and contexts rather than replacing them. Use React patterns like useMemo and useCallback for optimization.

### 6.2 Any patterns or anti-patterns to follow/avoid?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] 
Follow: React best practices, immutable updates, proper cleanup
Avoid: Direct DOM manipulation, synchronous blocking operations, memory leaks

### 6.3 Timeline or urgency considerations?
> Your answer: [Auto-generated] High priority enhancement as it directly impacts user experience. Should be implemented incrementally to avoid breaking changes.
