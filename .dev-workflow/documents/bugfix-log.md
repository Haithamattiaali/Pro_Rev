### Summary
Identified dual state management issue in FilterContext where both explicit period selection and implicit derivation from selections create conflicts. Solution applies Single Source of Truth pattern with period type as primary driver.

### Key Decisions
1. Remove automatic period derivation logic
2. Implement state validation guards
3. Clear invalid selections on period change
4. Add comprehensive state transition tests
