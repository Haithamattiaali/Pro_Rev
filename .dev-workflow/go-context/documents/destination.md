# Destination Document - Where We're Going

## Immediate Priorities (Today)

### 1. Verify Test Execution
**Critical**: Tests were created but not verified
- Run `npm test` to ensure tests pass
- Fix any failing tests
- Generate coverage report

### 2. Apply Test Refinements
**High Priority**: 5 refinement tasks pending
- Verify existing tests work
- Calculate actual coverage
- Create Overview.jsx tests
- Add Context provider tests
- Build test utilities

### 3. Achieve Testing Milestones
**Goal**: Reach measurable test coverage
- Current: ~4% (unverified)
- Target: 80%
- Gap: 33 more tests needed

## Success Criteria

1. **Test Infrastructure**: All generated tests passing
2. **Coverage Baseline**: Actual coverage percentage known
3. **Critical Components**: At least one page component tested
4. **Architectural Coverage**: Context providers have tests

## Next Development Phase

After testing foundations are verified:
1. Systematic test addition for remaining components
2. Integration test suite creation
3. CI/CD pipeline setup
4. E2E test framework initialization

## Constraints
- Maintain code quality while adding tests
- Ensure tests are maintainable
- Follow React Testing Library best practices
- Keep test execution time reasonable
