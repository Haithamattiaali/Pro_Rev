# Resolution: Production Deployment Verification

## Investigation Results

### Deployment Status: ✅ CONFIRMED DEPLOYED

The redeployment attempt showed:
- **Files uploaded**: 0
- **Meaning**: Netlify CDN already has the exact same files
- **Conclusion**: Your last commit WAS successfully deployed

### Why It Might Seem Different

1. **Browser Cache** (Most Likely)
   - Your browser is caching old JavaScript files
   - Solution: Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

2. **Service Worker Cache**
   - If the app uses service workers, they might cache old assets
   - Solution: Open DevTools → Application → Clear Storage

3. **CDN Edge Cache**
   - Different geographic locations might have different cache states
   - Usually resolves within 5-10 minutes

## Verification Steps

Please try these steps in order:

1. **Hard Refresh**:
   ```
   Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
   Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
   ```

2. **Test in Incognito/Private Mode**:
   - This bypasses all local caches
   - Should show the latest version immediately

3. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Refresh page
   - Look for: index-CvlKMq_W.js (this is the correct file)

4. **Test the Fix**:
   - Click between tabs (Overview → Business Units → Customers)
   - Should see smooth transitions, no flickering
   - All tabs should behave like Overview tab

## Deploy IDs for Reference
- Original deploy: 68907794336ce2746f24398b
- Verification deploy: 689078d6fd3c3ccebd9c48c0
- Both have identical content

## If Issue Persists

If after cache clearing you still see flickering:
1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Note which specific tabs show the issue
3. Try a completely different browser
4. Let me know the results

The deployment is confirmed successful - this appears to be a caching issue on your end.
