# Feedback Analysis: Production Deployment Issue

**Feedback**: "at development server everything is fine but at production i feel that the last commit didnt deployed"

## Analysis

### Current State
1. **Last Commit**: `80e0f5e fix(ui): apply optimized loading hook to all tabs preventing flickering transitions`
2. **Last Deployment**: 
   - Deploy ID: 68907794336ce2746f24398b
   - Time: Mon Aug 4 14:02:15 2025
   - Method: Netlify CLI direct deployment

### Potential Issues

1. **Browser Cache**: The production site might be serving cached assets
   - Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

2. **CDN Cache**: Netlify's CDN might be serving old assets
   - Solution: Wait a few minutes for cache invalidation
   - Check different browsers or incognito mode

3. **Build Hash Mismatch**: The build file shows `index-CvlKMq_W.js`
   - This should be the file with the optimized loading hooks

### Verification Steps

To confirm deployment status:

1. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Look for main JS bundle hash
   - Should be: index-CvlKMq_W.js

2. **Check Application Behavior**:
   - Click between tabs (Business Units, Customers, Sales Plan)
   - Should NOT see flickering/vibration
   - Transitions should be smooth like Overview tab

3. **Check Console**:
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Look for any errors
   - Check for console.log statements from optimized loading

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: 
   - Hard refresh the production site
   - Test in incognito/private browsing mode

2. **If Issue Persists**:
   - Check bundle served matches our build
   - Verify deployment actually included the changes
   - Consider redeploying with cache bust
