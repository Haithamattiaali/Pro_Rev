# Final Fix Summary - Filter Layout Jumping Issue

## Problem Identified
Based on the screenshot provided, the "CURRENTLY SHOWING" section was jumping/repositioning when clicking month buttons (like May). This was happening in the HierarchicalFilter layout where the FilterSummary component appears below the main filter bar.

## Root Causes
1. **Animation on every render** - FilterSummary had `initial={{ y: -10 }}` animation causing vertical movement
2. **Layout instability** - No layout containment, causing reflows when filter state changed
3. **Excessive spacing** - `space-y-3` created large gaps that amplified the jumping effect
4. **Height animations** - Quick presets row was animating height from 0 to auto

## Fixes Applied

### 1. FilterSummary Animation Fix
```jsx
// Changed from:
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -10 }}
// To:
initial={false}
```
Removed the vertical movement animation that was causing the jump.

### 2. Layout Stabilization
- Added `contain: 'layout'` to main filter bar
- Wrapped FilterSummary in a container with `minHeight: '60px'` and `contain: 'layout style'`
- Reduced spacing from `space-y-3` to `space-y-2`

### 3. Animation Optimizations
- Simplified Quick Presets animation to only fade opacity
- Reduced button hover/tap scale animations for smoother feel
- Added React.memo to HierarchicalFilter

### 4. Performance Improvements
- CSS containment prevents layout recalculation cascades
- Min-height prevents vertical shifts
- Removed unnecessary animations

## Results
✅ No more jumping when clicking months
✅ Stable "CURRENTLY SHOWING" section position
✅ Smoother overall filter interactions
✅ Better performance with layout containment

The filter UI now maintains a stable layout when selecting different periods!
