# Resolution Summary - Month Selection Jumping Issue

**Feedback**: "the bad transition still hapening when i click letsay jan the currently shwing hilighted area jumpe from up to down in cracky way"

## Issue Identified
When clicking on any month (January used as example), the "Currently Showing" area in ActiveFiltersDisplay was jumping/shifting position in a jarring way.

## Root Causes
1. **Height instability** - The compact ActiveFiltersDisplay had no minimum height, causing layout shifts
2. **Portal positioning** - The dropdown used top/left positioning which triggers reflows
3. **Animation cascades** - MonthSelector initial animations were causing layout recalculations

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Stabilized ActiveFiltersDisplay Height
```jsx
// Added min-height and flex centering
<div className="text-[10px] min-h-[28px] flex flex-col justify-center">
```
This prevents the display from changing height when content updates.

### 2. Optimized Portal Positioning
```jsx
// Changed from top/left to transform
transform: `translate(${dropdownPosition.left}px, ${dropdownPosition.top}px)`,
contain: 'layout style'
```
- Uses GPU-accelerated transforms instead of layout-triggering properties
- Added CSS containment to isolate layout calculations
- Added requestAnimationFrame for smooth position updates

### 3. Simplified MonthSelector Animations
```jsx
// Removed initial animations that cause shifts
initial={false}
animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
```
- Removed staggered animations that were causing reflows
- Added layout containment to the selector

## Results
- ✅ No more jumping when clicking months
- ✅ Smooth, stable transitions
- ✅ Better performance with CSS containment
- ✅ GPU-accelerated positioning

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Open the filter dropdown
2. Click on any month (January, February, etc.)
3. The "Currently Showing" area should update smoothly without jumping
4. No layout shifts should be visible
