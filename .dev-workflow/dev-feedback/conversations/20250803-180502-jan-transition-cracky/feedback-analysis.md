# Feedback Analysis: January Filter Transition Issue

**Feedback**: "the bad transition still hapening when i click letsay jan the currently shwing hilighted area jumpe from up to down in cracky way"

## Analysis

### Issue Description
When clicking on "Jan" (January) in the month selector, the "Currently Showing" highlighted area exhibits a jarring jump from top to bottom position. This suggests:

1. **Layout Shift**: The filter display is likely unmounting and remounting, causing position changes
2. **Height Recalculation**: The container might be recalculating its height when month selection changes
3. **Animation Conflict**: There might be conflicting animations between the selector and display components

### Specific Component Involved
Based on the description, this affects:
- **MonthSelector** component (where "Jan" is clicked)
- **FilterSummary** or **ActiveFiltersDisplay** (the "Currently Showing" area)
- Possible interaction with **TransitionWrapper** we recently added

### Root Cause Hypothesis
The issue likely stems from:
1. The TransitionWrapper animating height changes when months are selected/deselected
2. The filter display components re-rendering and causing layout recalculation
3. Missing transition coordination between selector and display components

## Proposed Investigation

1. **Check MonthSelector behavior**
   - How it handles click events
   - Whether it causes parent re-renders
   - Animation timing conflicts

2. **Examine FilterSummary positioning**
   - Is it absolutely positioned?
   - Does it have proper transition properties?
   - Height calculation issues

3. **Review TransitionWrapper integration**
   - Height animation might be causing the jump
   - Need to check if it's properly coordinated

## Immediate Actions
1. Reproduce the issue by clicking January
2. Inspect DOM changes during the transition
3. Check for layout shifts in DevTools
4. Review recent transition changes that might have introduced this
