# Resolution: Production Transition Classes Fixed

## Problem Identified
Tailwind CSS was purging transition-related utility classes in production build, causing:
- Logo hover transitions not working
- Button active states not animating
- Other transition effects missing

## Root Cause
During production build, Tailwind's PurgeCSS removes "unused" classes. Classes that are:
- Applied conditionally
- Part of hover/active states
- Used in dynamic class names

Were being removed because PurgeCSS couldn't detect them as "used".

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Safelist to Tailwind Config
```javascript
safelist: [
  'transition-opacity',
  'opacity-90',
  'opacity-100',
  'hover:opacity-100',
  'transition-all',
  'transition-transform',
  'duration-150',
  'duration-200',
  'duration-300',
  'ease-in-out',
  'transform',
  'scale-95',
  'scale-100',
  'active:scale-95',
]
```

### 2. Rebuilt and Redeployed
- CSS bundle increased from 74.71 KB to 75.18 KB (safelist classes included)
- Deploy ID: 689079bb1d9c624c24a9a836
- Status: ✅ LIVE

## Testing Instructions

Please clear cache and test:

1. **Logo Transitions**:
   - Hover over the logo
   - Should see smooth opacity transition (90% → 100%)

2. **Button Transitions**:
   - Click MTD/QTD/YTD buttons
   - Should see scale animation on click (active:scale-95)

3. **Other Transitions**:
   - Any hover effects should now work
   - Smooth state changes should be visible

## If Issues Persist

1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Check DevTools**: 
   - Inspect element
   - Look for transition classes in Elements panel
   - Verify classes are not crossed out

## Prevention for Future

When adding dynamic or conditional classes:
- Add them to safelist if they're critical
- Or use full class names (not constructed strings)
- Test production build locally: `npm run build && npm run preview`

The transitions should now work correctly in production!
