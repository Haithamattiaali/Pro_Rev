# Feedback Analysis: Remove Tab Animations

**Feedback**: "its not requiered that at filtering the part that show the tab name just under the currently showing part to vibrate or animate"

## Analysis

The user is referring to unnecessary animations/vibrations in the filter UI, specifically in the area that shows tab names below the "CURRENTLY SHOWING" section. This suggests there are animations that are distracting or unwanted when interacting with the filter.

### Components Involved
Based on the feedback and previous work:
1. **ViewModeToggle** - Shows Yearly/Quarterly/Monthly tabs
2. **QuickRangePresets** - Shows YTD/QTD/MTD quick selection buttons
3. **PeriodSelector** - Shows month/quarter selection buttons
4. **Motion animations** - Various hover/tap animations throughout

### Issue
The user finds the animations on these filter elements unnecessary and distracting. They want a more stable, professional interface without vibrations or excessive animations.

## Proposed Solution

1. **Remove/reduce animations on tab selections**
   - Remove or minimize whileHover and whileTap animations
   - Keep only essential visual feedback (color changes)
   - Remove any spring animations

2. **Stabilize the interface**
   - Remove unnecessary motion effects
   - Keep transitions smooth but subtle
   - Focus on functional feedback over decorative animations

3. **Professional, calm UI**
   - Prioritize stability and clarity
   - Use only CSS transitions for state changes
   - Remove all "vibration" or "bounce" effects
