# Rethink Cycle 2
Date: 2025-08-05T13:05:00+03:00
Phase: Deep Analysis

## New Information from Questionnaire
- Recent changes confirmed: Updated gross profit formula, removed pro-rated columns
- No error messages - application runs but shows wrong values
- Production-only issue - development is correct

## Refined Understanding
Based on the answers:
1. Root cause narrowing down to deployment/caching issue
2. Pattern identified: Old formula still active in production
3. Confidence level: 95%
4. Need to verify: Production build and deployment process

## Deployment Analysis
- Frontend uses Vite for building
- The build command is `vite build`
- Deployment likely through Netlify (based on previous context)
- No explicit cache-busting in build process

## Cache Investigation
Production might be affected by:
1. Browser cache (user-side)
2. CDN cache (Netlify/CloudFlare)
3. Service worker cache
4. Build artifacts not updated

## Action Required
Immediate fix: Force rebuild and redeploy
Long-term fix: Implement cache-busting strategy
