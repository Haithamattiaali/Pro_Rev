Bug: Production shows SAR 1,288,208 but dev shows SAR 1,197,662 for gross profit

## Current Understanding
Building on previous insights:
- Initial bug report suggests: Production and development environments show different gross profit calculations
- The difference is SAR 90,546 (about 7.6% higher in production)
- Formula confirmed: grossProfit = revenue - (revenue/target) * cost
- Need to explore calculation differences between environments

New observations:
- Examined 68 potentially relevant files
- Patterns emerging in the codebase - both frontend and backend have profit calculation utilities
- The backend formula uses performance-based cost calculation
- Need deeper analysis of deployment status

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Is the formula the same in production? - Production might have old code
2. Are the input values (revenue, target, cost) the same? - Data might differ
3. Is the calculation happening in the same place? - Could be frontend vs backend
4. Are both environments using the latest code? - Deployment lag possible
5. Is there a caching issue? - Old values might be cached

## Hypotheses Forming
- Refined Hypothesis 1: Production has old calculation formula (before performance-based cost)
- Refined Hypothesis 2: Data values differ between production and dev databases
- Refined Hypothesis 3: Frontend calculation mismatch with backend in production

## Knowledge Gaps
- When was production last deployed?
- What are the exact input values in both environments?
- Is the calculation happening on frontend or backend?
- Are there any deployment logs?
- Is there a version mismatch?

## Next Steps
- Check production deployment status
- Compare exact data values between environments
- Verify if latest code changes are in production
