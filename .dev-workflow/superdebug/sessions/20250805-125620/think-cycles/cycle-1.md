Bug: Production shows SAR 1,288,208 but dev shows SAR 1,197,662 for gross profit

## Current Understanding
- Initial bug report suggests: Production and development environments show different gross profit calculations
- The difference is SAR 90,546 (about 7.6% higher in production)
- This matches the earlier 91,000 discrepancy we investigated
- Need to explore codebase for calculation differences between environments

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Is the bug description accurate? - Need to verify actual values in both environments
2. Are we looking in the right place? - Should check both frontend and backend calculations
3. Could this be a symptom of a larger issue? - Possibly related to the pro-rated columns we removed
4. Are there multiple contributing factors? - Could be data differences or formula differences
5. Is this actually a bug or expected behavior? - Need to understand deployment status

## Hypotheses Forming
- Hypothesis 1: Direct cause in reported area - Different calculation formulas in production vs dev
- Hypothesis 2: Integration issue between components - Frontend/backend mismatch
- Hypothesis 3: Environmental or configuration problem - Production database has different data or old code

## Knowledge Gaps
- What exactly triggers this bug? - Need to know specific data being calculated
- What are the expected vs actual behaviors? - Which environment has the correct value?
- Are there any error messages or logs? - Need to check production logs
- What recent changes might be related? - We recently removed pro-rated columns
- How can we reproduce this consistently? - Need to check same data in both environments

## Next Steps
- Need more information about production deployment status
- Should investigate if latest code changes are deployed
- Must validate calculation formulas in both environments
