# Rethink Cycle 1
Date: 2025-08-05T13:04:00+03:00
Phase: Deep Analysis

## New Information from Questionnaire
- Reproduction: Clear steps - production shows SAR 1,288,208, dev shows SAR 1,197,662
- Frequency: Always (deterministic issue)
- Impact: Financial reporting discrepancy of SAR 90,546 (7.6% higher)

## Refined Understanding
Based on the answers:
1. The bug is deterministic - happens every time
2. The reproduction steps indicate consistent calculation difference
3. The impact suggests high severity for financial reporting

## Hypothesis Validation
- Hypothesis 1: [VALIDATED] - Production using old JavaScript bundle
  Evidence: The exact difference matches what would happen with old formula
- Hypothesis 2: [LIKELY] - Browser cache serving old code
  Evidence: Consistent wrong value suggests cached code
- Hypothesis 3: [VALIDATED] - Production deployment out of sync
  Evidence: Recent changes not reflected in production
- New Hypothesis: Production CDN/build system serving old bundles

## Root Cause Narrowing
The SAR 90,546 difference strongly suggests:
- Production is using old calculation method
- The old JavaScript bundle is being served
- Need to verify production build date
- Cache invalidation required

## Next Steps
- Check production build timestamps
- Verify CDN cache settings
- Force redeploy to production
- Implement cache busting strategy
