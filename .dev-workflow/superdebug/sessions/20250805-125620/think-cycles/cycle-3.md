Bug: Production shows SAR 1,288,208 but dev shows SAR 1,197,662 for gross profit

## Current Understanding
Building on previous insights:
- Formula confirmed in both frontend and backend: grossProfit = revenue - (revenue/target) * cost
- CRITICAL FINDING: Frontend has a legacy calculation function that uses: target - cost
- The legacy function is marked as deprecated but might still be in use
- Both environments have the same new formula in their current code

New observations:
- Frontend and backend formulas match exactly (good consistency)
- Legacy function exists that could explain the discrepancy
- The difference of SAR 90,546 could be explained by different calculation methods
- Production might be using old code or cached JavaScript

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Is production using the latest JavaScript bundle? - Likely NOT
2. Is the legacy function still being called somewhere? - Need to check
3. Could browser caching be serving old code? - Very possible
4. Has the production build been updated? - Deployment verification needed
5. Are there any references to the legacy function? - Must search codebase

## Hypotheses Forming
- Final Hypothesis 1: Production is using old JavaScript bundle with legacy calculation
- Final Hypothesis 2: Browser cache is serving outdated frontend code
- Final Hypothesis 3: Production deployment is out of sync with development

## Knowledge Gaps
- When was the last production deployment?
- Is there a build version indicator?
- Are users experiencing cached JavaScript?
- What's the production build date?
- How to force cache refresh in production?

## Next Steps
- Check for any remaining usage of legacy calculation function
- Verify production deployment status
- Need to clear production caches or redeploy
