# Rethink Cycle 3
Date: 2025-08-05T13:06:00+03:00
Phase: Deep Analysis

## New Information from Questionnaire
- Always occurs in production
- Development has correct calculation
- No workarounds available
- Clear financial impact

## Refined Understanding
Based on all analysis:
1. Root cause identified with high confidence
2. Production is serving old JavaScript bundle
3. Fix approach determined: Rebuild and redeploy with cache clearing
4. Risk assessment: Low risk fix, high impact bug

## Final Validation
Evidence supporting root cause:
1. SAR 90,546 difference matches old vs new formula difference
2. Only affects production environment
3. Development shows correct values with new formula
4. Recent deployment of calculation changes
5. No code references to legacy function (so not a code issue)

## Solution Path
1. Immediate: Force production rebuild and deploy
2. Clear all caches (CDN, browser)
3. Verify new bundle is served
4. Add version indicators to prevent future issues

## Confidence Assessment
- Root cause confidence: 95%
- Fix approach confidence: 90%
- Risk of regression: Low
