# Bug Hypotheses
Generated: 2025-08-05T13:01:00+03:00
Bug: Production shows SAR 1,288,208 but dev shows SAR 1,197,662 for gross profit

## Primary Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Outdated JavaScript Bundle in Production
- Location: Frontend JavaScript files served to users
- Evidence: Legacy calculation function exists (target - cost) that would produce higher values
- Test: Check production bundle date and compare with deployment history

### Hypothesis 2: Browser Cache Serving Old Code
- Location: User browsers caching old JavaScript
- Evidence: Production shows old calculation result pattern
- Test: Force refresh or check in incognito mode

### Hypothesis 3: Production Not Deployed with Latest Changes
- Location: Production deployment pipeline
- Evidence: Development has new formula, production shows old result
- Test: Check deployment logs and build timestamps

## Secondary Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 4: Different Data Values
- Location: Production vs development databases
- Evidence: Same formula could produce different results with different inputs
- Test: Compare exact revenue, target, and cost values

### Hypothesis 5: Mixed Frontend/Backend Calculation
- Location: API responses vs frontend calculations
- Evidence: Could be using frontend for display but backend for export
- Test: Check network requests and compare values

## Questions to Validate
1. When was production last deployed?
2. What is the production build timestamp?
3. Are all users seeing the same incorrect value?
4. Can we reproduce by clearing cache?
5. What are the exact input values for the calculation?
