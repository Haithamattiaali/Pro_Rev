# Debug Session Final Report
Session ID: 20250805-135532-etl
Date: 2025-08-05T14:05:00+03:00

## Bug Summary
**Original Issue**: "may be the etl" - Production showing wrong gross profit
**Root Cause**: Missing original_cost column in database - migration was commented out
**Fix Applied**: Uncomment migration and run on production
**Status**: FIX PLAN READY

## Debug Process Summary
- Mode: auto
- Think Cycles: 3 initial
- Time to Root Cause: ~10 minutes
- Confidence Level: 95%

## Key Findings
1. ETL process is working correctly - not the issue
2. Database schema missing critical original_cost column
3. Migration was commented with "REMOVED: Pro-rating no longer used"
4. Backend code expects original_cost for performance calculations

## Solution
1. Uncomment migration in backend/scripts/run-migrations.js
2. Run migration to add original_cost column
3. Populate original_cost with existing cost values
4. Backend will then calculate performance costs correctly

## Implementation Tasks
- 8 tasks created in TodoWrite
- 5 high priority (immediate fix)
- 2 medium priority (prevention)
- 1 low priority (documentation)

## Lessons Learned
1. Database schema must match backend expectations
2. Don't remove columns without understanding dependencies
3. "Pro-rating" != "Performance-based calculations"
4. Need schema validation on startup

## Session Artifacts
- Think Cycles: 3 completed with progressive refinement
- Root Cause: Definitively identified missing column
- Fix Plan: Step-by-step implementation guide
- Tasks: Created in TodoWrite for tracking

Debug session identified database schema issue, not ETL problem!
Ready for implementation of fix.
