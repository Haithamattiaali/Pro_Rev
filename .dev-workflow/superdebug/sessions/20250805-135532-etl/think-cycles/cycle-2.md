Bug: may be the etl

## Current Understanding
Building on previous insights:
- ETL service directly stores raw Cost values from Excel
- No performance-based cost calculations in ETL
- ETL doesn't populate original_cost column
- Database stores only the raw cost value from Excel import

New observations:
- Examined etl.service.js - it's a simple data importer
- ETL inserts: cost, target, revenue, receivables_collected, days
- No business logic or calculations applied during ETL
- ETL uses ON CONFLICT to update existing records

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Is the database schema missing original_cost column?
2. Should ETL calculate performance costs or leave it to runtime?
3. Is production database schema different from development?
4. Are we looking at the wrong layer for the issue?
5. Could this be a deployment sync issue rather than ETL?

## Hypotheses Forming
- Refined Hypothesis 1: Production database schema is outdated (missing original_cost column)
- Refined Hypothesis 2: ETL correctly stores raw data, but runtime calculations fail
- Refined Hypothesis 3: The issue is NOT in ETL but in how production serves the data

## Knowledge Gaps
- Does production database have the original_cost column?
- When was the database schema last migrated on production?
- Is the production backend code actually using the new calculation logic?
- Are there any database migrations that haven't run on production?

## Next Steps
- Need to check database schema for original_cost column
- Should verify if migrations have run on production
- Must confirm production backend code version
- Check if this is a deployment issue, not an ETL issue
