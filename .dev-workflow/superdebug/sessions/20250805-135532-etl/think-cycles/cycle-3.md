Bug: may be the etl

## Current Understanding
Building on previous insights:
- ETL is NOT the problem - it correctly stores raw data
- Database schema is missing original_cost column
- Migration for original_cost is COMMENTED OUT in run-migrations.js
- Backend code expects original_cost but database doesn't have it

New observations:
- Found commented migration: ALTER TABLE revenue_data ADD COLUMN original_cost
- Comment says "REMOVED: Pro-rating no longer used"
- But the backend code still uses original_cost for performance calculations
- This explains why production returns wrong values

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Was original_cost intentionally removed? NO - it's needed for new formula
2. Is the backend code wrong? NO - it's correct, database is wrong
3. Is this an ETL issue? NO - ETL is fine, it's a schema issue
4. Should we add the column back? YES - it's required
5. Is this why production shows wrong values? YES - confirmed

## Hypotheses Forming
- Final Hypothesis 1: Missing original_cost column causes backend to return raw cost
- Final Hypothesis 2: Comment "Pro-rating no longer used" was misunderstood
- Final Hypothesis 3: Performance-based calculation needs original_cost column

## Root Cause Identified
The original_cost column migration was commented out, but the backend code requires it for the new performance-based cost calculation formula. Without this column, the backend cannot distinguish between original and performance-adjusted costs.

## Next Steps
- Uncomment the original_cost migration
- Run the migration on production database
- Populate original_cost with current cost values
- Redeploy backend to ensure proper calculation
