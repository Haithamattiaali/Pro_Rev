Bug: may be the etl

## Current Understanding
- Initial bug report suggests: may be the etl
- Context: Production showing SAR 1,288,208 instead of SAR 1,197,662 for gross profit
- Production API returns original cost (2,672,422) not performance-adjusted cost (2,484,582)
- Local environment shows correct calculations
- Need to explore ETL process for data storage issues

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Is the bug in the ETL process during data import?
2. Are we storing the wrong values in the database?
3. Could the ETL be overwriting performance calculations?
4. Are there multiple ETL processes that might conflict?
5. Is this a data transformation issue or a calculation issue?

## Hypotheses Forming
- Hypothesis 1: ETL process stores original costs without applying performance adjustments
- Hypothesis 2: ETL runs after deployment and overwrites correct calculations
- Hypothesis 3: Production database has stale data from old ETL runs

## Knowledge Gaps
- How does the ETL process handle cost calculations?
- When was the last ETL run on production?
- Does ETL recalculate or just import raw data?
- Are there any scheduled ETL jobs that might interfere?
- What's the exact data flow from Excel upload to database?

## Next Steps
- Need to examine etl.service.js for cost handling
- Should check database schema for cost-related columns
- Must understand the upload and transformation process
- Verify if ETL applies business logic or just imports raw data
