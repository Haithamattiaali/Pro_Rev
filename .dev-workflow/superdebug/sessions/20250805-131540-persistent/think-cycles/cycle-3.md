Bug: Production still showing SAR 1,288,208 after deployment

## Current Understanding
Building on previous insights:
- CRITICAL: The gross profit is calculated on the BACKEND, not frontend
- Frontend (Netlify) only displays the value from API
- Backend is hosted on Render with autoDeploy enabled
- We pushed code to master which should trigger both deployments

New observations:
- render.yaml shows backend auto-deploys from master branch
- Backend is in the /backend subdirectory
- The calculation happens in backend/services/data.service.js
- Backend deployment might be slower than frontend

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Did Render deployment complete? - Need to check Render dashboard
2. Did Render deployment succeed? - Could have failed
3. Is autoDeploy working? - Might need manual trigger
4. Is the backend healthy? - Health check might be failing
5. How long does Render deployment take? - Could still be in progress

## Hypotheses Forming
- Final Hypothesis 1: Render deployment is still in progress (most likely)
- Final Hypothesis 2: Render deployment failed and needs manual intervention
- Final Hypothesis 3: Render autoDeploy is disabled or not working

## Root Cause Identified
The issue is that we only verified frontend deployment (Netlify) but the actual calculation happens on the backend (Render). The backend either:
1. Hasn't finished deploying yet
2. Failed to deploy
3. Needs manual deployment trigger

## Next Steps
- Check Render deployment status
- Wait for backend deployment to complete
- If failed, trigger manual deployment
- Verify API returns correct value after deployment
