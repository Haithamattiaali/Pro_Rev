Bug: Production still showing SAR 1,288,208 after deployment

## Current Understanding
Building on previous insights:
- The gross profit value is NOT calculated on frontend
- Overview.jsx displays `overview.profit` directly from API response
- Data comes from `dataService.getOverviewData()` which calls the backend
- This means the backend API is still returning SAR 1,288,208

New observations:
- Frontend bundle rebuild was unnecessary - calculation happens on backend
- The issue is with the production backend, not frontend
- Production backend is still using old calculation formula
- Need to check backend deployment status

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Is the backend deployed separately from frontend? - YES, likely on Render
2. Did we only deploy frontend to Netlify? - YES, that's the problem
3. Is production backend a separate service? - Need to verify
4. Are backend and frontend in same repo? - YES, but deployed separately
5. When was backend last deployed? - This is the key question

## Hypotheses Forming
- Refined Hypothesis 1: Backend on Render/Heroku still has old code
- Refined Hypothesis 2: Frontend deployed to Netlify, but backend unchanged
- Refined Hypothesis 3: Production backend needs separate deployment

## Knowledge Gaps
- Where is the production backend hosted?
- How is the backend deployed?
- When was it last deployed?
- What's the backend deployment process?

## Next Steps
- Check backend hosting platform (Render/Heroku/etc)
- Verify backend deployment configuration
- Deploy backend with new calculation code
