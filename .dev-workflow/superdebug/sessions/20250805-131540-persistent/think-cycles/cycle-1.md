Bug: Production still showing SAR 1,288,208 after deployment

## Current Understanding
- Initial bug report suggests: Deployment didn't fix the issue, production still shows wrong value
- The value is displayed in MetricCard component with specific CSS classes
- We found the exact location: src/components/cards/MetricCard.jsx line 35
- Previous fix attempted to rebuild and redeploy, but issue persists
- Need to explore why the fix didn't work

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Did the deployment actually complete on Netlify? - Need to verify
2. Is the browser cache cleared? - User might have cached version
3. Is the calculation happening on frontend or backend? - Critical to know
4. Is Netlify serving the latest build? - CDN cache might be stale
5. Is the component receiving correct data? - Data flow issue possible

## Hypotheses Forming
- Hypothesis 1: Netlify deployment is still pending or failed
- Hypothesis 2: CDN/Browser cache is serving old JavaScript bundle
- Hypothesis 3: The calculation is happening server-side and backend wasn't updated

## Knowledge Gaps
- What is the actual deployment status on Netlify?
- Is the gross profit calculated on frontend or backend?
- When was the last successful deployment?
- Are all users seeing the wrong value or just this user?
- What's the exact data flow from API to MetricCard?

## Next Steps
- Need to trace data flow from API to MetricCard
- Check if calculation happens in frontend or backend
- Verify Netlify deployment status
- Test with cache bypass
