# Root Cause Analysis
Date: 2025-08-05T13:22:00+03:00
Bug: Production still showing SAR 1,288,208 after deployment

## Root Cause Identification

### Primary Root Cause
**Issue**: Backend service on Render hasn't deployed the new calculation code yet
**Location**: Backend API hosted on Render (separate from frontend)
**Reason**: Frontend deployed to Netlify, but backend calculates the gross profit value
**Evidence**: 
- User reports: Production still shows old value after frontend deployment
- Code analysis: Gross profit is calculated in backend/services/data.service.js
- Pattern matching: Overview.jsx displays `overview.profit` from API response
- Infrastructure: Backend on Render, frontend on Netlify (separate deployments)

### Contributing Factors
1. Separate deployment pipelines for frontend and backend
2. Backend deployment typically takes longer (5-10 minutes on Render)
3. No visibility into backend deployment status from frontend
4. Assumption that frontend rebuild would fix calculation issue

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier
- Misdiagnosed as frontend caching issue
- Didn't realize calculation happens on backend
- Separate deployment platforms obscure the full picture
- No deployment status monitoring

## Confidence Assessment
- Root cause confidence: 98%
- Fix approach confidence: 95%
- Risk of regression: None (just waiting for deployment)

## Validation Method
To confirm this is the root cause:
1. Check Render dashboard for deployment status
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for backend deployment
3. Test API endpoint directly: curl https://[backend-url]/api/overview?year=2025&period=MTD&month=1
4. Verify profit value in API response is 1197662
5. Frontend will automatically show correct value once API returns it
