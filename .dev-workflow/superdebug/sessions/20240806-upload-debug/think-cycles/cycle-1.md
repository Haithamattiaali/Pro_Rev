Bug: File upload shows 'no data' despite containing data

## Current Understanding
- User uploads an Excel file that contains data
- System reports "no data" and no database update occurs
- The error message comes from two possible places:
  1. server.js line 164: "File uploaded successfully but no data was found"
  2. etl.service.js line 109: "No data found in the uploaded file"

## Key Code Flow Identified
1. Upload endpoint receives file at `/api/upload`
2. ETL service processes the Excel file using `xlsx.readFile()`
3. Each sheet is converted to JSON using `xlsx.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet)`
4. If jsonData.length === 0, it returns "no data" message
5. The hasData check in server.js looks at totalRecords from all sheets

## Assumptions to Challenge
1. Is the Excel file format correct?
2. Are the sheet names matching expected patterns?
3. Does the data start at row 1 with headers?
4. Are there hidden sheets or formatting issues?
5. Is the XLSX library reading the file correctly?

## Hypotheses Forming
- Hypothesis 1: Excel file structure doesn't match expected format
- Hypothesis 2: Sheet names don't match patterns (revenue, sales plan, opportunities)
- Hypothesis 3: Data is present but in unexpected location/format in the sheet

## Knowledge Gaps
- What is the exact structure of the uploaded Excel file?
- What column headers are expected?
- Are there any logs showing what sheets were found?
- What does the xlsx.utils.sheet_to_json return for this file?
- Is there a sample working Excel file format?

## Next Steps
- Need to see console logs from the ETL process
- Check expected Excel file format/structure
- Verify sheet naming conventions
- Test with a known working file
