# Think Cycle 2
Date: 2025-08-05
Phase: Deep Analysis

## New Information from Investigation

1. **Refresh Trigger Pattern**:
   - `triggerRefresh()` is used in pages for retry functionality
   - NOT directly called on filter clicks
   - Only Upload.jsx calls it after successful upload
   - Pages call it for manual retry on error

2. **Filter Click Flow**:
   - Filter clicks → `updatePeriod()` → `handlePeriodChange()`
   - Uses requestAnimationFrame for animation coordination
   - Updates FilterContext state
   - Does NOT clear cache on filter changes

3. **Cache Architecture**:
   - DataService has 30-minute cache timeout
   - Implements stale-while-revalidate pattern
   - ConnectionManager doesn't interact with cache
   - CacheContext provides stats but doesn't control caching

## Refined Understanding

Based on the answers:
1. The bug is deterministic - happens on every click in production
2. Cache clearing is NOT the root cause (filters don't trigger refresh)
3. Must be environment-specific issue

## Hypothesis Validation

- Hypothesis 1: [REJECTED] - Click handlers don't call triggerRefresh
- Hypothesis 2: [VALIDATED] - Likely production environment issue
- Hypothesis 3: [NEEDS INVESTIGATION] - Could be CORS/headers
- New Hypothesis: Production requests bypass cache or cache keys differ

## Pattern Identified

The issue seems to be:
1. Dev environment: Cache works normally
2. Production: Every request appears as cache miss
3. No explicit cache clearing on clicks

## Possible Root Causes

1. **Cache Key Generation**: Production URLs might differ
2. **Request Headers**: Cache-Control or no-cache headers
3. **CORS**: Preventing cache storage
4. **Service Worker**: Interfering with cache
5. **CDN/Proxy**: Adding cache-busting params

## Next Investigation Steps

- Check production network requests for cache headers
- Compare dev vs prod request URLs
- Look for environment-specific code
- Check for service workers or CDN configuration
