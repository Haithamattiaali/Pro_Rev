Bug: Caching logic works in dev but not in production - data loading on each click

## Current Understanding

- User reports caching works in development environment
- In production, data loads on every single click (no caching)
- This creates cracky/unsmooth loading transitions
- Logo issue is now fixed

## Key Observations from Code Analysis

1. **DataService Cache Configuration**:
   - Cache timeout: 30 minutes
   - Stale timeout: 60 minutes
   - Uses stale-while-revalidate pattern
   - Has cache warming on startup
   - Implements cache hit/miss tracking

2. **CacheContext**:
   - Provides cache stats and loading states
   - Updates stats every 5 seconds
   - Has cache warming indicator

3. **DataRefreshContext**:
   - `triggerRefresh()` CLEARS the entire cache\!
   - This could be the root cause if triggered on clicks

4. **ConnectionManager**:
   - Does health checks
   - No direct cache interaction

## Assumptions to Challenge

1. Is something triggering `triggerRefresh()` on every click in production?
2. Are there environment-specific behaviors affecting cache?
3. Is the cache actually being populated in production?
4. Are production requests failing and falling back to empty cache?
5. Is there a CDN or proxy clearing cache headers?

## Hypotheses Forming

- Hypothesis 1: Click handlers are calling `triggerRefresh()` unnecessarily
- Hypothesis 2: Production environment has different cache headers
- Hypothesis 3: CORS or security settings prevent cache storage
- Hypothesis 4: Production API responses differ from dev

## Knowledge Gaps

- What exactly happens on click in production?
- Are cache headers being sent/received?
- Is localStorage/sessionStorage being used?
- What's the network tab showing in production?
- Are there any console errors in production?

## Next Steps

- Search for onClick handlers that might trigger refresh
- Check for environment-specific code
- Look for cache header configurations
- Examine production network requests
