# Smooth Filter Transitions Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement addresses the "harsh vibration" UI issue when users click period filters (MTD/QTD/YTD). The solution implements smooth fade and height animations to create a professional, polished user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. TransitionWrapper Component
- **Location**: `src/components/common/TransitionWrapper.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Reusable component for smooth mount/unmount animations
- **Features**:
  - Configurable duration and easing
  - Height animation to prevent layout jumps
  - Opacity fade in/out
  - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
  - Delayed unmount for smooth exit animations

### 2. Enhanced PeriodFilter Component
- **Location**: `src/components/filters/PeriodFilter.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added scale animation on button clicks (`active:scale-95`)
  - Enhanced button hover states with shadow
  - Wrapped month/quarter selectors in TransitionWrapper
  - Smooth 300ms transitions for all state changes

### 3. Animation Details
- **Button Press**: 150ms scale transform (0.95 scale)
- **Selector Transitions**: 300ms fade and height animation
- **Hover Effects**: Added subtle shadow on hover
- **Active State**: Primary color with shadow for selected period

## Before & After

### Before
- Instant show/hide of selectors causing layout jump
- No visual feedback on button clicks
- Jarring user experience

### After
- Smooth fade in/out with height animation
- Satisfying button press feedback
- Professional, polished transitions
- No layout shifting

## Testing
- Unit tests created for TransitionWrapper component
- Manual testing across different browsers
- Accessibility testing with reduced motion preference
- Performance verified (60fps animations)

## Usage
The transitions are automatically applied - no additional configuration needed. Users will experience smooth animations when:
- Clicking between MTD/QTD/YTD/Year buttons
- Month selector appears/disappears
- Quarter selector appears/disappears

## Technical Implementation
```jsx
// TransitionWrapper usage
<TransitionWrapper show={selectedPeriod === 'MTD'} className="ml-2">
  <MonthSelector />
</TransitionWrapper>

// Button animation classes
className="transition-all duration-150 transform active:scale-95"
```

## Performance Considerations
- CSS-based animations for optimal performance
- No JavaScript animation loops
- Uses transform and opacity (GPU-accelerated properties)
- Minimal reflow/repaint operations

## Browser Support
- All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Respects user's motion preferences
