=======================

This file is used to force new deployments when code changes might not be detected.

Deployment History:
- August 5, 2025 14:30 EAT: Force deployment to fix gross profit calculation
  - Issue: API returning original_cost instead of performance-adjusted cost
  - Fix: Ensure original_cost migration runs on production
  - Version: 1.0.5-august-5-fix

IMPORTANT: The original_cost column migration must run for correct calculations.
