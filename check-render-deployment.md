# Render Deployment Status Check

## Current Situation
All code fixes have been implemented and pushed to GitHub:

### Commits Pushed:
1. **970a8ee** - Force migration to run during build process
2. **857953a** - Fix data service SQL queries to use original_cost column  
3. **8b49340** - Fix all legacy profit calculations throughout backend
4. **9733cb3** - Fix legacy profit calculations in backend services

### What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ Migration script - uncommented to add original_cost column
2. ✅ SQL queries - using COALESCE(original_cost, cost, 0)
3. ✅ Business logic - using calculatePerformanceCost() and calculateGrossProfit()
4. ✅ Scripts - all using utility functions
5. ✅ API structure - returns both cost and originalCost

### Production Status (as of now):
- ❌ API not returning `originalCost` field
- ❌ Profit showing 1,288,208 instead of 1,197,662
- ❌ Old code still running

## How to Check Deployment Status

### 1. Check Render Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your "proceed-backend" service
3. Check the "Events" or "Deploys" tab
4. Look for deployment status

### 2. Check GitHub Actions (if configured)
1. Go to https://github.com/Haithamattiaali/Pro_Rev/actions
2. Check if deployment workflow triggered

### 3. Manual Deployment (if auto-deploy failed)
1. In Render dashboard, click "Manual Deploy"
2. Select "Deploy latest commit"
3. Monitor the build logs

## Expected After Successful Deployment

```bash
curl "https://proceed-revenue-backend.onrender.com/api/overview?year=2025&period=MTD&month=1" | jq '.overview'
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "revenue": 3682243.85,
  "target": 3525463,
  "cost": 2484582.08,        // Performance-adjusted
  "originalCost": 2672422.23, // Original from Excel
  "profit": 1197661.77,       // Correct value
  "profitMargin": 32.52
}
```

## If Deployment Is Stuck

1. **Check Build Logs** - Look for errors during npm install or migration
2. **Force Redeploy** - Add environment variable and remove it
3. **Check Disk Mount** - Ensure /var/data is available if using persistent storage
4. **SSH to Service** - Run migration manually if needed
