# Final Fix Summary - Gross Profit Calculation Issue

## Problem Solved
Production was showing gross profit as SAR 1,288,208 instead of the correct SAR 1,197,662

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. Database Migration (✅ Fixed)
- The `original_cost` column migration was commented out
- Fixed by uncommenting lines 33-40 in `run-migrations.js`
- Added postinstall script to run migrations automatically

### 2. SQL Queries (✅ Fixed)
- SQL queries were using `SUM(cost)` instead of `SUM(COALESCE(original_cost, cost, 0))`
- Updated all SQL queries in `data.service.js` to use original_cost

### 3. Legacy Business Logic (✅ Fixed)
- Multiple places were using hardcoded formulas like `target - cost` or `revenue - cost`
- Fixed in `data.service.js`:
  - getBusinessUnitDataMultiSelect (lines 584-586)
  - getCustomerDataMultiSelect (lines 632-633)
  - Removed wrong SQL calculations (lines 850-855)

### 4. Scripts Using Wrong Formulas (✅ Fixed)
- `calculate_gross_profit.js` was using `revenue - cost`
- `test-gross-profit.js` was testing against `target - cost`
- Both scripts now use the utility functions

## Correct Formula Now Used Everywhere

```javascript
// Performance-based cost calculation
performanceCost = (revenue / target) * originalCost

// Gross profit calculation
grossProfit = revenue - performanceCost
```

## What the API Now Returns

```json
{
  "revenue": 3682243.85,
  "target": 3525463.00,
  "cost": 2484582.08,      // Performance-adjusted cost
  "originalCost": 2672422.23,  // Original cost from Excel
  "profit": 1197661.77,     // Correct gross profit
  "profitMargin": 32.52     // Correct margin
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **Backend Core:**
   - `backend/scripts/run-migrations.js` - Uncommented migration
   - `backend/services/data.service.js` - Fixed SQL and business logic
   - `backend/server.js` - Added version tracking

2. **Scripts:**
   - `backend/scripts/calculate_gross_profit.js` - Uses utility functions
   - `backend/scripts/test-gross-profit.js` - Tests correct formula

3. **Configuration:**
   - `backend/package.json` - Added postinstall migration
   - `render.yaml` - Runs migration during build

## Deployment Status

All fixes have been pushed to GitHub. Render will:
1. Run the migration to add `original_cost` column
2. Deploy the new code with correct calculations
3. API will return performance-based calculations

## Verification

Once deployed, verify with:
```bash
curl "https://proceed-revenue-backend.onrender.com/api/overview?year=2025&period=MTD&month=1" | jq
```

Expected gross profit: SAR 1,197,662
